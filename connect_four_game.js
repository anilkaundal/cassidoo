/*
Make a 2-player Connect Four game, where the board is 7 units wide,
and 6 units high. Your program should take in user input when a player
puts in a piece, and have functions boardState() (which returns a 2D
array of the current state of the board) and hasWon() which returns
which player has won the game (if any).
